# APPEND

### Syntax:

```bash
APPEND key value
```

###### **Available since:** 1.0.0
###### **Time complexity:** O(1). The amortized time complexity is O(1) assuming the appended value is small and the already present value is of any size, since the dynamic string library used by Redis will double the free space available on every reallocation.

###### **Description:** If key already exists and is a string, this command appends the value at the end of the string. If key does not exist it is created and set as an empty string, so APPEND will be similar to SET in this special case.

#### Examples

```bash
orion> EXISTS mykey
(integer) 0
orion> APPEND mykey "Hello"
(integer) 5
orion> APPEND mykey " World"
(integer) 11
orion> GET mykey
"Hello World"
orion> 

```
