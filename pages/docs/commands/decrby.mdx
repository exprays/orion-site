# DECRBY

### Syntax:

```bash
DECRBY key decrement
```

###### **Available since:** 1.0.0
###### **Time complexity:** O(1)

###### **Description:** The DECRBY command reduces the value stored at the specified key by the specified decrement. If the key does not exist, it is initialized with a value of 0 before performing the operation. If the key's value is not of the correct type or cannot be represented as an integer, an error is returned. This operation is limited to 64-bit signed integers.

See INCR for extra information on increment/decrement operations.

#### Examples

```bash
orion> SET mykey "10"
"OK"
orion> DECRBY mykey 3
(integer) 7
orion> 


```
