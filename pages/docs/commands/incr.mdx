# INCR

### Syntax:

```bash
INCR key
```

###### **Available since:** 1.0.0
###### **Time complexity:** O(1)

###### **Description:** Increments the number stored at key by one. If the key does not exist, it is set to 0 before performing the operation. An error is returned if the key contains a value of the wrong type or contains a string that can not be represented as integer. This operation is limited to 64 bit signed integers.

Note: this is a string operation because Redis does not have a dedicated integer type. The string stored at the key is interpreted as a base-10 64 bit signed integer to execute the operation.

Redis stores integers in their integer representation, so for string values that actually hold an integer, there is no overhead for storing the string representation of the integer.


#### Examples

```bash
orion> SET mykey "10"
"OK"
orion> INCR mykey
(integer) 11
orion> GET mykey
"11"
orion> 


```
