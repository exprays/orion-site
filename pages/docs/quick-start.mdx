# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the OrionDB Quick Start Guide! This guide will help you get OrionDB up and running quickly. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Go Installed**: Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed on your machine.
- **Git**: Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed for version control.
- **Docker**: Optional, if you prefer using Docker, make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) is installed.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Clone the Project

First, clone the OrionDB repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/exprays/orion
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd orion
```

### Step 2: Start the server

```bash
go run main.go --mode=server --port=6379
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  OrionDB will start on port 6379. You can change the port by modifying the --port flag.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Start the client

```bash
go run main.go --mode=client 127.0.0.1:6379
```

In another terminal, start the OrionDB client to conect to the server.

### Step 4: Basic Commands

Once connected, you can start using basic commands. Here are a few examples:

Set a Key-Value Pair:

```bash
SET key1 "Hello, OrionDB!"
```
Get a Value:

```bash
GET key1
```

Delete a Key:

```bash
DEL key1
```

</Steps>

# Using Docker

Alternatively, you can run OrionDB using Docker. This method is convenient if you prefer containerized environments.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Pull the Docker Image
First, pull the OrionDB Docker image from the Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull exprays/orion:latest
```
### Step 2: Run the Docker Container
Run the Docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 exprays/orion:latest
```

This will start the OrionDB server in a Docker container and map port 6379 on your host to the container.

### Step 3: Connect to the Docker Container
Use Orion client to connect to OrionDB running in the Docker container:

```bash
orion-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379
```

</Steps>

You can now interact with the OrionDB server running inside the Docker container.

Congratulations! You've successfully set up OrionDB and connected to it. Explore further documentation to leverage the full potential of OrionDB.
