# Using the release package

If you are a nerd or a experienced developer, there is no easy way to run an app rather than executables. Follow the steps to use it on the go.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Download the Latest releases of Orion from github

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Download the orion.exe and hunter.exe files on your windows PC.
You can ignore the Windows smartscreen error because the apps are not digitally signed yet. They are on trials.
</Callout>

You can Download it [here](https://github.com/exprays/orion/releases)

### Step 2: Run the orion.exe
Double click on the file to run the orion server.


### Step 3: Run the hunter.exe
Hunter is our database client which is used to interact with database. Learn more [here](https://orion.thestarsociety.tech/docs/packages/hunter)

It will prompt you to enter the server address. Enter <code>127.0.0.1:6379</code> for this case. Then hit enter!

### Step 4: Now you are ready to go! Play with commands and explore.
